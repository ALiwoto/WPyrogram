        .. include:: /_includes/usable-by/users.rst

        Parameters:
            chat_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the target chat.

            topic_ids (``int`` | Iterable of ``int``, *optional*):
                Pass a single topic identifier or an iterable of topic ids (as integers) to get the information of the
                topic themselves.

        Returns:
            :obj:`~pyrogram.types.ForumTopic` | List of :obj:`~pyrogram.types.ForumTopic`: In case *topic_ids* was not
            a list, a single topic is returned, otherwise a list of topics is returned.

        Example:
            .. code-block:: python

                # Get one topic
                await app.get_forum_topics_by_id(chat_id, 12345)

                await app.get_forum_topics_by_id(chat_id, [12345, 12346])

        Raises:
            ValueError: In case of invalid arguments.
