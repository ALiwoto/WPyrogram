        .. include:: /_includes/usable-by/users-bots.rst

        Parameters:
            chat_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the target user.
                For your personal story you can simply use "me" or "self".
                For a contact that exists in your Telegram address book you can use his phone number (str).

            story_ids (List of ``int`` ``32-bit``):
                Pass a single story identifier or an iterable of story ids (as integers) to get the content of the
                story themselves.

        Returns:
            :obj:`~pyrogram.types.Story` | List of :obj:`~pyrogram.types.Story`: In case *story_ids* was not
            a list, a single story is returned, otherwise a list of stories is returned.

        Example:
            .. code-block:: python

                # Get stories by id
