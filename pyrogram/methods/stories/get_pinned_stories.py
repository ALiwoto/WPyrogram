        .. include:: /_includes/usable-by/users.rst

        Parameters:
            chat_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the target chat.

            offset_id (``int``, *optional*):
                Offset event identifier from which to start returning results.
                By default, no offset is applied and events will be returned starting from the latest.

            limit (``int``, *optional*):
                Maximum amount of events to be returned.
                By default, all events will be returned.

        Yields:
